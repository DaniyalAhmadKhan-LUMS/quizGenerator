      "   Answer: \n",
      "   - The paradox lies in the time it takes to gather data to evaluate an executive's performance # \n",
      "   - An executive's performance is evaluated based on the output of their organization, which takes time to build and manage #\n",
      "   - However, a poor performing executive can cause more damage than a normal employee, hence the need to fire them as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Explanation: \n",
      "   - The text mentions that it takes time to gather data to evaluate an executive's performance, which forms the first part of the paradox # \n",
      "   - The second part of the paradox is that an executive's performance is not evaluated based on their own output, but on the output of their organization. This is because they are responsible for building and managing their organization to generate output #\n",
      "   - The third part of the paradox is that while it takes longer to evaluate an executive, they can cause more damage than a normal employee if they don't perform well. This is why it's more important to fire a bad executive as quickly as possible.\n",

      "   - Andy Grove believed that a bad executive is always fired too late #\n",
      "   - If you're really good, you'll fire her about three months too late #\n",
      "   - Firing too quickly could risk being viewed as arbitrary and capricious by the rest of the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Explanation: \n",
      "   - The text mentions that Andy Grove, one of the world's best CEOs, believed that a bad executive is always fired too late. This is because it takes time to gather enough data to evaluate their performance #\n",
      "   - The second point is based on Grove's belief that if you're really good, you'll fire a bad executive about three months too late. This suggests that even the best leaders struggle with the timing of firing a bad executive #\n",

      "   - Talk to everyone and know what's going on.\n",
